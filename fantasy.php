      <div>Mariel Spark knows not to trust a demon, especially one that wants her soul,
        but what’s a witch to do when he won’t leave her side—and she kind of doesn’t want him to?

        Mariel Spark is prophesied to be the most powerful witch seen in centuries of the famed Spark family, but to the
        displeasure of her mother, she prefers baking to brewing potions and gardening to casting hexes. When a spell to
        summon flour goes very wrong, Mariel finds herself staring down a demon—one she inadvertently summoned for a
        soul
        bargain.

        Ozroth the Ruthless is a legend among demons. Powerful and merciless, he drives hard bargains to collect mortal
        souls. But his reputation has suffered ever since a bargain went awry—if he can strike a bargain with Mariel, he
        will earn back his deadly reputation. Ozroth can’t leave Mariel’s side until they complete a bargain, which she
        refuses to do (turns out some humans are attached to their souls).</div>

  <div class="popup" onclick="myFunction('myPopup4')">The God of Endings
    <span class="popuptext" id="myPopup4">
      <img src="img/fan4.jpg"></img>
      <div>By turns suspenseful and enchanting, this breathtaking first novel weaves a
        story of love, family, history, and myth as seen through the eyes of one immortal woman

        Collette LeSange is a lonely artist who heads an elite fine arts school for children in upstate New York. Her
        youthful beauty masks the dark truth of her life: she has endured centuries of turmoil and heartache in the wake
        of her grandfather’s long-ago decision to make her immortal like himself. Now in 1984, Collette finds her life
        upended by the arrival of a gifted child from a troubled home, the return of a stalking presence from her past,
        and her own mysteriously growing hunger.

        Combining brilliant prose with breathtaking suspense, The God of Endings serves as a larger exploration of the
        human condition in all its complexity, asking us the most fundamental question: is life in this world a gift or
        a
        curse?

      <div>Darling Seabreak cannot remember anything before the murder of her family at
        the hands of House Dragon, but she knows she owes her life to both the power of her Chaos Boon and House Kraken
        for liberating her from the sewers where she spent her childhood. So when her adoptive Kraken father is captured
        in battle, Darling vows to save him--even if that means killing each and every last member of House Dragon.

        Talon Goldhoard has always been a dutiful War Prince for House Dragon, bravely leading the elite troops of his
        brother, the High Prince Regent. But lately his brother's erratic rule threatens to undo a hundred years of
        House
        Dragon's hard work, and factions are turning to Talon to unseat him. Talon resists, until he's ambushed by a
        fierce girl who looks exactly like the one his brother has painted obsessively, repeatedly, for years, and Talon
        knows she's the key to everything.</div>
