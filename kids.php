        Product Description:
        It's almost Easter time and Brother, Sister, and Honey Cub can't stop thinking about all the Easter candy that
        they want to eat. They know that Easter is about more than just candy, it's also about "Bible stuff". It's up to
        their Sunday School teacher Miss Ursula and some of the older cubs to teach them why we celebrate Easter.

        a sheet of stickers.
