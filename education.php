      <div>
        Where do we learn math: From rules in a textbook? From logic and deduction?
        Not really, according to mathematician Eugenia Cheng: we learn it from human curiosity—most importantly, from
        asking questions. This may come as a surprise to those who think that math is about finding the one right
        answer,
        or those who were told that the “dumb” question they asked just proved they were bad at math. But Cheng shows
        why
        people who ask questions like “Why does 1 + 1 = 2?” are at the very heart of the search for mathematical truth.
